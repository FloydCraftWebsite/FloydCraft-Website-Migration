<p>Does this work with classic/older versions?</b><br />
Of course!</p>
<p>The original creator of mcMMO is back working on mcMMO full time, pumping out constant updates. 2.1 is available now and had 300+ hours go into it, 2.2 is coming soon and you can read more about it <a class="externalLink" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DENmwZrgHfFB7ktSIHs9u2rbmPRXeqHavQZFuzwJilg/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about the new updates for mcMMO, read the <b>massive</b> <a class="externalLink" href="https://mcmmo.org/#changelog" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">changelog for 2.1 here</a>!</p>
<p><b>Classic mcMMO</b><br />
Looking for the classic mcMMO experience? You can find that <a class="internalLink" href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/mcmmo.2445/">here</a>.</p>
<p><b>Installation &amp; Upgrading Help</b><br />
mcMMO is very simple to install, you can upgrade from older versions no problem. Just drag and drop and you&#8217;re ready to go! You will not lose any data upgrading mcMMO ever!</p>
<p>If you would like to know more about installing mcMMO, check out this <a class="externalLink" href="https://mcmmo.org/wiki/Installation_guide" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">installation guide</a>.</p>
<p><b>Why Premium</b>?<br />
I feel mcMMO is worth the premium price tag, with over 3 million downloads and it almost being mandatory on many servers, posting it as a premium resource will allow me to spend more time developing it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve come back after a 5-6 year absence to work on mcMMO again, and this new update is the result of over a month of work. And it is just the first of many updates coming to mcMMO. I spent nearly 8-14 hours a day working on this thing! I&#8217;d really appreciate it if you&#8217;d consider purchasing it <img class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie15" title="Smile    :)" src="https://www.spigotmc.org/styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" alt=":)" /></p>

<b>Back in action!</b><br />
Hello, you may not know me but I&#8217;m the original author and the main designer of mcMMO. Almost everything you see in the plugin was designed by me with a few exceptions. It&#8217;s been a long time but I&#8217;ve decided to come back and continue development of mcMMO. Recently project lead has been handed back to me from gmcferrin and new development will be starting ASAP.</p>
<p>I would like to give a shout out to <a class="username" href="https://www.spigotmc.org/members/24032/" data-user="24032, @t00thpick1">@t00thpick1</a> who had done an excellent job at maintaining the plugin and keeping it running over the years.</p>
<p>If you would like to follow development, keep an eye on the discussion thread and <a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/nossr50" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">my twitter</a>!</p>

<p><b>nossr50&#8217;s Recommended Plugins</b></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for other high quality plugins to pair with mcMMO, the following I can personally recommend. These were made by top notch devs, experts among experts.</p>
<p><a class="internalLink" href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/griefdefender.68900/">GriefDefender</a> (Anti-Grief / Land Claim)<br />
Possibly <i><b>the best</b></i> grief protection plugin ever made. The number of hours Bloodshot has poured into this are immeasurable, I can certify this plugin was made by someone vastly over qualified for such a task. Originally made for Sponge and now fully converted and compatible with Spigot, this is a must have for any server admin who is looking for land claim/anti grief plugins.</p>
<p><b>Are you using NoCheatPlus? (Or any other anti-cheat plugin?)</b><br />
Anti-cheat plugins may conflict with mcMMO, if you&#8217;re using NoCheatPlus be sure to grab the compatibility plugin <a class="externalLink" href="http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/compatnocheatplus-cncp/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">CompatNoCheatPlus</a> to solve conflicts with mcMMO.</p>
<p><b>Bug Report</b><br />
Feel free to post an issue with the plugin on our <a class="externalLink" href="https://github.com/mcMMO-Dev/mcMMO/issues" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">github issue tracker</a>.</p>
