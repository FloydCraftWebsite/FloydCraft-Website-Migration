										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Dungeons on FloydCraft are custom made for player experience (not including DungeonWorld). They are in a variety of worlds and styles and most can be gotten to through /warp. New ones are constantly being added or changed, so keep an eye out!</p>
<p>The Dungeons range from easy that a recently new player could complete it to so difficult that you need friends. Their difficulty also scales their loot. So something easy will get you low-mid tier gear while a long and hard dungeon might get you end tier gear like mending or diamond or even netherite on the hardest ones!(once 1.16 is released and a affiliate dungeon is made upon update)</p>
<p>Dungeons restrict some powers when entering however, most disable fly,  god, heal, or /thru or /top in some cases. This is to provide balance with the limited AI of mobs in Minecraft. Whether you have nothing else to do or want a challenge try the dungeons some time! Might be worth the time.</p>
