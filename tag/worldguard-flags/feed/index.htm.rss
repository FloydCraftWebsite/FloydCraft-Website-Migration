<p><b>How to use?</b><br />
Simply use the WorldGuard region flag command. All of the flags can be interacted that way, just like any other flag.</p>
<p><b>FAQ:</p>
<p>Which Minecraft versions are supported?</b><br />
From 1.7 even up to 1.16.4, please keep in mind you still need to pick the correct WorldGuard version, which are listed below</p>
<p><b>Which WorldGuard version should I use?</b><br />
The most up to date version that is compatible with your version of Minecraft. These are tested versions and works as intended.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>WorldGuard 6.1.2 OR LOWER</b>
<ul>
<li><b>NOT SUPPORTED, PLEASE UPGRADE, READ BELOW FOR RECOMMENDED VERSIONS</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>WorldGuard 6.2.0
<ul>
<li><b>Minecraft:</b> From 1.7 up to 1.11</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>WorldGuard 6.2.2
<ul>
<li><b>Minecraft</b>: 1.12</li>

<p><b>Can I bypass flag with permissions?</b><br />
You can bypass any flag by using the following permission node:</p>
<p>worldguard.region.bypass.&lt;world&gt;.&lt;region&gt;.&lt;flag&gt;</p>
<p>If your permission plugin supports wildcars they can by used to block all custom flags in region using:</p>
<p>worldguard.region.bypass.&lt;world&gt;.&lt;region&gt;.*</p>
<p><b>Flag is not working:</b><br />
Make sure you do not have permissions for the following permission node:</p>
<p>worldguard.region.bypass.&lt;world&gt;.&lt;region&gt;.&lt;flag&gt;</p>
<p>Also make sure you have use-player-move-event set to true in WorldGuard config.</p>
<p>Please also note that if you are OP you have all the permissions, meaning that you are bypassing every flag the plugin provides. This can look like the plugin is not working.</p>
<p>Also /rg bypass doesn&#8217;t work, at least yet.</p>
<p><b>Respawn-location flag is not working:</b><br />
Read up the flag is not working part first before trying this. Some other plugins are known to cause problems with respawn-location flag by choosing some other location to respawn the player instead of the location provided by the flag.</p>
<p>If you are using Essentials you can fix this by changing the respawn-listener-priority to lowest or low in the Essentials config.</p>
<p><b>Can I use multiple commands?</b><br />
Yes, use comma to separate them.</p>
<p><b>Can I get the player&#8217;s username when executing a command?</b><br />
You can use the %username% placeholder</p>
<p><b>What if my command contains commas?</b><br />
Wrap the command in quotation marks and it will be seen as one whole command.</p>
<p><b>A word about custom commands</b><br />
Custom commands do not work as they are not &#8220;real&#8221; commands. Using plugins like Skript where you can define your own commands are seen as &#8220;fake&#8221; commands and their existence is unknown.</p>
<p><b>What are the values for walk-speed?</b><br />
The flag uses same values as Minecraft does. The default value being 0.2</p>
<p><b>What are the values for play-sounds?</b><br />
These values depend on your Minecraft server version. Any value that works with /playsound works as value here.</p>
<p><b>Server crashes when using teleport commands in command-on-entry or in command-on-exit:</b><br />
Using teleport commands is not supported and there is a special flags for them; teleport-on-entry and teleport-on-exit. These flags are more careful when teleporting the player around and tries to prevent any circular teleport loops.</p>
<p><b>When using keep-inventory flag my inventory gets duplicated:</b><br />
This is not the plugins fault and some other plugin is conflicting with the flag.</p>
<p><b>I want to give a player permission when they enter a region.</b><br />
You should <b>NEVER </b>in any situation to use command-on-entry flag&#8217;s to give out permissions. Instead, you should use the following extension for LuckPerms: <a class="externalLink" href="https://github.com/LuckPerms/ExtraContexts" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/LuckPerms/ExtraContexts</a></p>
