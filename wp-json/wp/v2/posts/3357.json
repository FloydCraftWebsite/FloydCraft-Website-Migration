All punishments are UUID-based.<\/li>\n<li>Fully customizable kick screen for banned players, multiple lines and colours can be used, as well as ban information variables \u2013 duration until ban expires, reason, staff member who placed the ban, time since ban was placed, original ban duration, server which ban was placed on, etc.<\/li>\n<li>All messages are customizable in messages.yml. There are many useful variables available to place in any configurable message that involves a ban, mute, or warning. Hover-text is supported.<\/li>\n<li>Multiple types of databases are supported, including MySQL, MariaDB, and H2. H2 is used by default, meaning that MySQL is not needed to use LiteBans with a single-server setup.<\/li>\n<li>Advanced light cross-server synchronization system allows global punishments and broadcasts to instantly take effect across all servers connected to the same database.<\/li>\n<li>Offline players can receive warnings; they will see all of their new warnings when they join. This works across servers.<\/li>\n<li>When a player with a banned account on the same IP joins, all players with the right permissions will be notified.<\/li>\n<li>You can view punishment history for players (\/history) and punishments issued by staff members (\/staffhistory).<\/li>\n<li>Staff members can be &#8220;rolled back&#8221; \u2013 all punishments which they&#8217;ve issued can be removed at any time with a single command. Staff abuse has never been easier to deal with.<\/li>\n<li>Players cannot override punishments by setting very short bans or mutes unless they have permission.<\/li>\n<li>Bans can be imported from vanilla (including Essentials), and six popular free banning plugins, including MaxBans, BanManager, AdvancedBan, and BungeeAdminTools.<\/li>\n<li>Lightweight, multithreaded, and designed for performance. LiteBans uses a minimal amount of memory and does not block the main server thread with any database queries after startup.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div><b>Cross-Server Synchronization<\/b><br \/>\n\u200b<\/div>\n<p>One of the best features of LiteBans for networks is its cross-server synchronization system.<\/p>\n<p>For example:<\/p>\n<p>Server A, Server B and Server C are all running LiteBans, connected to the same MySQL database.<\/p>\n<p>If a player who is on Server A is muted on Server B, it will immediately take effect on Server A, the player will be muted, and all players on Server A, B and C will see the broadcast indicating that the player was muted if they have permission and if broadcast synchronization is enabled. If the player leaves Server A and joins Server B or Server C, they will still be muted.<\/p>\n<p>This applies to both Spigot and BungeeCord versions of the plugin.<\/p>\n<p>A BungeeCord proxy counts as a server, and all servers under the BungeeCord proxy will also be affected by the plugin<br \/>\n(if the plugin is installed in the Bungee plugin folder).<\/p>\n<div><b>Web Interface<br \/>\n<\/b>\u200b<\/div>\n<p>The web interface lists all bans, mutes, warnings, and kicks.<br \/>\nIt can be used to view all punishments for specific players or by staff, and check when those punishments will expire.<br \/>\n* Free website is\u00a0<b>not<\/b>\u00a0included, you will require your own website hosting.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"bbCodeImage LbImage\" src=\"https:\/\/www.spigotmc.org\/attachments\/litebans-php-1-png.339927\/\" alt=\"litebans-php-1.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"bbCodeImage LbImage\" src=\"https:\/\/www.spigotmc.org\/attachments\/litebans-php-2-png.341368\/\" alt=\"litebans-php-2.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Installation guide:\u00a0https:\/\/gitlab.com\/ruany\/litebans-php\/wikis\/Installation<\/p>\n<div><b>JSON Support<\/b>\u200b<\/div>\n<p>LiteBans allows you to define custom hover text in all messages, including broadcasts.<br \/>\nOnly players with permission (<i>litebans.json.hover_text<\/i>) will see the hover text.<br \/>\nAll variables available to use in messages.yml can also be included in hover text, along with colors and newlines.<br \/>\n<img class=\"bbCodeImage LbImage\" src=\"https:\/\/www.spigotmc.org\/attachments\/litebans_hovertext-png.361225\/\" alt=\"LiteBans_HoverText.png\" \/><br \/>\nExample:<\/p>\n<div class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeCode\">\n<div class=\"type\">Code (Text):<\/div>\n<div class=\"code\">broadcast_ban: &#8216;&amp;e$bannedPlayer &amp;chas been banned. {hoverText: &amp;aHover text here!}&#8217;<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div><b>Commands<\/b>\u200b<\/div>\n<p>The ban command (\/ban) can be used like this:<\/p>\n<p><i>\/ban [-s] &lt;target&gt; [duration] [reason] [server:*]<\/i><br \/>\nAlso:\u00a0<i>\/tempban, \/ipban, \/unban<\/i><\/p>\n<p><i>&lt;target&gt;\u00a0<\/i>can be a name, UUID, or IP address.<\/p>\n<p>If you IP-ban a player, their UUID and IP address will be banned simultaneously, so they cannot join on the same account using a different IP address.<\/p>\n[server:*] is an optional parameter which can be used when the plugin is installed on BungeeCord or if you have multiple instances of LiteBans.<br \/>\nBy default, all punishments are global (*).<br \/>\nServer scopes (per-server punishments) are explained in detail on the wiki\u00a0here.<\/p>\n<p>Example: \/ban Player 7d [reason] server:Survival<\/p>\n<p>The<b>\u00a0\/ban<\/b>\u00a0and\u00a0<b>\/mute\u00a0<\/b>commands have a permanent duration if not specified.

Requires &#8220;use_database_time: true&#8221; in config.yml across all servers. (See wiki:\u00a0Timezones)<br \/>\n\/litebans unlink &lt;player&gt;: Unlinks all IP addresses for the given player from \/alts. This unassociates the targeted accounts. If these accounts are joined by the same IP again in future, they will be re-associated.<br \/>\n\/litebans cleariphistory &lt;name\/UUID\/IP&gt;: Clears IP history for a specific name, UUID, or IP address. The unlink command is recommended as it will allow punishment history to render correctly.<br \/>\nPlayers with no IP history will not show up on \/history, \/staffhistory, or the web interface, because their name cannot be matched to a UUID. When they rejoin the server, their ban history will reappear.<br \/>\n\/litebans fixhistory: Adds missing username+UUID entries to the history table. This can be used after cleariphistory, but this only works in online-mode because the usernames are fetched from Mojang.<br \/>\n\/litebans addhistory &lt;name&gt; &lt;UUID&gt; &lt;IP&gt;: Allows you to add IP history to the database directly.<br \/>\n\/litebans broadcast &lt;message&gt;: This command allows you to broadcast any message using the LiteBans broadcast channel. The message will reach all servers connected to the same database, it can contain chat colours and newlines, and only players with &#8220;litebans.notify.broadcast&#8221; will see it. The &#8220;broadcast-type:&lt;perm&gt;&#8221; argument allows you to override the permission required to see the broadcast (litebans.notify.&lt;perm&gt;), and this command requires the &#8220;litebans.broadcast&#8221; permission.<br \/>\nNote that the message can include hover text. For example: &#8220;\/litebans broadcast Test message {hoverText: Example Hover Text}&#8221;<br \/>\n\/litebans import start: Begins the import process after importing has been configured in config.yml.<br \/>\n\/litebans reset-database: Clears all punishments from the database.
