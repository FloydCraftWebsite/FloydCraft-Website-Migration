These are tested versions and works as intended.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>WorldGuard 6.1.2 OR LOWER<\/b>\n<ul>\n<li><b>NOT SUPPORTED, PLEASE UPGRADE, READ BELOW FOR RECOMMENDED VERSIONS<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>WorldGuard 6.2.0\n<ul>\n<li><b>Minecraft:<\/b>\u00a0From 1.7 up to 1.11<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>WorldGuard 6.2.2\n<ul>\n<li><b>Minecraft<\/b>: 1.12<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>WorldGuard 7.0.0\n<ul>\n<li><b>Minecraft:\u00a0<\/b>1.13<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>WorldGuard 7.0.3\n<ul>\n<li><b>Minecraft:\u00a0<\/b>From 1.14 to 1.15<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>WorldGuard 7.0.4\n<ul>\n<li><b>Minecraft:\u00a0<\/b>1.16<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Can I bypass flag with permissions?<\/b><br \/>\nYou can bypass any flag by using the following permission node:<\/p>\n<p>worldguard.region.bypass.&lt;world&gt;.&lt;region&gt;.&lt;flag&gt;<\/p>\n<p>If your permission plugin supports wildcars they can by used to block all custom flags in region using:<\/p>\n<p>worldguard.region.bypass.&lt;world&gt;.&lt;region&gt;.*<\/p>\n<p><b>Flag is not working:<\/b><br \/>\nMake sure you do not have permissions for the following permission node:<\/p>\n<p>worldguard.region.bypass.&lt;world&gt;.&lt;region&gt;.&lt;flag&gt;<\/p>\n<p>Also make sure you have use-player-move-event set to true in WorldGuard config.<\/p>\n<p>Please also note that if you are OP you have all the permissions, meaning that you are bypassing every flag the plugin provides. This can look like the plugin is not working.<\/p>\n<p>Also \/rg bypass doesn&#8217;t work, at least yet.<\/p>\n<p><b>Respawn-location flag is not working:<\/b><br \/>\nRead up the flag is not working part first before trying this.

Using plugins like Skript where you can define your own commands are seen as &#8220;fake&#8221; commands and their existence is unknown.<\/p>\n<p><b>What are the values for walk-speed?<\/b><br \/>\nThe flag uses same values as Minecraft does. The default value being 0.2<\/p>\n<p><b>What are the values for play-sounds?<\/b><br \/>\nThese values depend on your Minecraft server version. Any value that works with \/playsound works as value here.<\/p>\n<p><b>Server crashes when using teleport commands in command-on-entry or in command-on-exit:<\/b><br \/>\nUsing teleport commands is not supported and there is a special flags for them; teleport-on-entry and teleport-on-exit.
