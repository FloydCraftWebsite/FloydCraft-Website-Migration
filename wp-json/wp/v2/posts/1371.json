It is fully multi-world compatible to allow \/home to be used in any world. You can also set a default spawn location for new visitors to your server.<\/p>\n<p>When using \/home or \/spawn or \/work you can choose to have a teleport effect to tell other players they have teleported. Options include Lightning, Ender Signal, Smoke and Flames.<\/p>\n<p>This is a very lightweight plugin, using SQLite to store all data in one compact file.<\/p>\n<p>If players do not have access to \/sethome, using any bed will set their \/home location.<\/p>\n<p>Originally created for: PeanutPower, owner of FunnyCreeper (<a href=\"https:\/\/dev.bukkit.org\/linkout?remoteUrl=http%253a%252f%252ffunnycreeper.enjin.com%252f\" rel=\"nofollow\">funnycreeper.enjin.com<\/a>)<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"title-3\">Features<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Spawn commands<\/li>\n<li>Home Commands<\/li>\n<li>Work Commands<\/li>\n<li>Jail \/ Release Commands<\/li>\n<li>Player to Player teleport commands<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 id=\"title-4\">Installation<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Put the .jar file in your \/plugins folder<\/li>\n<li>Reload your plugins\/server<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 id=\"title-5\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.curseforge.com\/wiki\/invalid-link\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Commands<\/a><\/h2>\n<h2 id=\"title-6\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.curseforge.com\/wiki\/invalid-link\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Permissions<\/a><\/h2>\n<h2 id=\"title-7\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.curseforge.com\/wiki\/invalid-link\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Configuration<\/a><\/h2>\n<h2 id=\"title-8\">Source Code<\/h2>\n<p>Source code can be found on my\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/github.com\/ellbristow\" rel=\"nofollow\">GitHub Page<\/a><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"title-9\">Other Projects<\/h2>\n<p>See my\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/dev.bukkit.org\/profiles\/ellbristow\/server-mods\" rel=\"nofollow\">Other Projects<\/a><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"title-10\">Errors \/ Bugs \/ FeatureRequests<\/h2>\n<p>If you find errros \/ bugs please open a ticket and give detailed information about craftbukkit version, and plugin version.
