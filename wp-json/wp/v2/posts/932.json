To do so, they can simply type \/auc hand to sell whatever they are holding in their hand, or \/auc start to be presented with a chest interface to put their items in. If everything is alright, the auction will be publicly announced and the plugin will claim the item and start accepting bids.<\/p>\n<p>Placing a bid means declaring the\u00a0<strong>maximum amount<\/strong>\u00a0you are willing to pay for the item. After the auction times out, the participant with the highest bid wins, but all he has to pay is\u00a0<strong>just enough to beat the second highest bid<\/strong>. This is how many online auction houses function.<\/p>\n<p>The result of this system is that sniping, that is overbidding by a small amount in the last second, becomes very difficult. Also players don&#8217;t have to worry about placing an unnecessarily high bid when nobody else is interested in paying nearly as much. They can just declare the maximum amount right away and be guaranteed to pay up to that but no more, and only as much as is necessary to win. Also, nobody else will know about it unless they bid even more.<\/p>\n<h2>Language<\/h2>\n<p>All in-game chat output is configurable and CraftBay comes with several language files: English (en_US), German (de_DE), Simplified Chinese (zh_CN), and Russian (ru_RU). The preferred language can be chosen in the configuration file and adjusted via configuration files.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Source: https:\/\/dev.bukkit.org\/projects\/craftbay\u00a0 |\u00a0 https:\/\/github.com\/StarTux\/CraftBay Intended use Despite the wide availability of shopping plugins, an auction is still the best way for auctioneers to achieve the maximum price for their goods by reaching a broad audience and having them duke it out.
