You can designate a text channel for the plugin to listen on where messages sent to that channel are run as commands by the server console. You should restrict sending this channel to a developer or high ranking role only. Due to how Discord&#8217;s permissions work, though, you can have some server roles being able to see the console, yet not being able to send messages in that channel, thus creating a read-only console for trusted staff members.<\/p>\n<p>Both the chat and console link are toggleable through the configuration file. Some, but not all, options can be refreshed with \/discord reload, by an op. VanishNoPacket permissions like silent join\/quit, fake join\/quit and join without announcing are checked when sending player join messages in the chat channel.<\/p>\n<p><b>Install<\/b><br \/>\n<b><i>Java 8 is required.<\/i><\/b>\u00a0It&#8217;s recommended to go to DiscordSRV&#8217;s wiki at\u00a0<a class=\"externalLink\" href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Scarsz\/DiscordSRV\/wiki\/Installation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/github.com\/Scarsz\/DiscordSRV\/wiki\/Installation<\/a>\u00a0for picture instructions or watch one of the vidoes below to walk you through the installation.<br \/>\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/xKETqmm3yHY?wmode=opaque\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><\/iframe><br \/>\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/9qeQWa1ch6A?wmode=opaque\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><\/iframe><br \/>\nIf you want a straight-forward install, though, you can just follow these steps:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a new application at\u00a0<a class=\"externalLink\" href=\"https:\/\/discordapp.com\/developers\/applications\/me\/create\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/discordapp.com\/developers\/applications\/me\/create<\/a><\/li>\n<li>On the application&#8217;s page, click &#8220;Create a Bot User&#8221; and confirm<\/li>\n<li>Install the plugin, run &amp; stop the server, then open the configuration file<\/li>\n<li>Paste in the token from the application page to the config<\/li>\n<li>Go to\u00a0<a class=\"externalLink\" href=\"https:\/\/scarsz.me\/authorize\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/scarsz.me\/authorize<\/a>\u00a0&amp; paste your application&#8217;s Client ID value to the page<\/li>\n<li>In the config option labeled Channels, input your global chat channel&#8217;s ID under &#8220;global&#8221;- you can set more channels up here and their linked channels.\n<ol>\n<li>For reference, to obtain a channel ID, go to the cog on the bottom left of Discord, go to the appearance tab, enable developer mode.
