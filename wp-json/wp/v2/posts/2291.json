They are in a variety of worlds and styles and most can be gotten to through \/warp. New ones are constantly being added or changed, so keep an eye out!<\/p>\n<p>The Dungeons range from easy that a recently new player could complete it to so difficult that you need friends. Their difficulty also scales their loot. So something easy will get you low-mid tier gear while a long and hard dungeon might get you end tier gear like mending or diamond or even netherite on the hardest ones!(once 1.16 is released and a affiliate dungeon is made upon update)<\/p>\n<p>Dungeons restrict some powers when entering however, most disable fly,\u00a0 god, heal, or \/thru or \/top in some cases. This is to provide balance with the limited AI of mobs in Minecraft. Whether you have nothing else to do or want a challenge try the dungeons some time!
