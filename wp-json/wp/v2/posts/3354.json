Theres a config option to determine the max amount of Pillagers per outpost, the default value is 16, and I do not recommend setting it too low. The plugin doesn&#8217;t actually look for outposts it just counts the amount of pillagers near an attempted spawn. Setting this value too low may cause Pillager spawns across the world to be too low (ie: in raids)<\/p>\n<p><b>COMMANDS<\/b>:<br \/>\n&#8211;\u00a0<b>pillager-count:<\/b>\u00a0This is a simple command just to count the amount of Pillagers in a 100 block radius around you.
