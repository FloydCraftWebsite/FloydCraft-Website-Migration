The ultimate goal of this project is to allow Minecraft: Bedrock Edition users to join Minecraft: Java Edition servers as seamlessly as possible. Please note, this project is still a work in progress and should not be used on production. Expect bugs!<\/p>\n<p>To allow Xbox Live authentication on your server (i.e. Minecraft: Bedrock Accounts) you need to install\u00a0<a class=\"externalLink\" href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/GeyserMC\/Geyser\/wiki\/Floodgate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Floodgate<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Special thanks to the DragonProxy project for being a trailblazer in protocol translation and for all the team members who have now joined us here!<\/p>\n<p><b>Setup<\/b><br \/>\nBedrock clients will join through Geyser and it will handle all the packet translations. There are four different versions of Geyser: Geyser for Bukkit (works on derivatives such as Spigot and Paper), Geyser for BungeeCord (also works on Waterfall), Geyser for Velocity, and Geyser Standalone. The first three versions run as plugins and can be installed directly onto the server. The standalone version can be used in a similar way, except you run it separately.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"externalLink\" href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/GeyserMC\/Geyser\/wiki\/Setup#plugin-setup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Setup Instructions &#8211; Plugin<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a class=\"externalLink\" href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/GeyserMC\/Geyser\/wiki\/Setup#plugin-setup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Setup Instructions &#8211; BungeeCord<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a class=\"externalLink\" href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/GeyserMC\/Geyser\/wiki\/Setup#standalone-setup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Setup Instructions &#8211; Standalone<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you are running a server, it is highly recommended you use one of the plugin versions, and if you want to join a server that does not have Geyser installed, you can run the standalone version.
