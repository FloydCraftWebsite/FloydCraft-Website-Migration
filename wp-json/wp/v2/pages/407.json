You can pay them around $40 and have a small area to build in so other people who are also doing the same thing can see what you&#8217;re up tp.. wow typing that sounds sad lol..<\/span>\u00a0 <span style=\"color: #ffcc99;\">anyway we have taken part in this event before because it seemed like a good cause, Build a booth, share with the community and help to raise money for there chosen charity. they seem to be raising less each year now too, read below and I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll understand why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; color: #ffff99; font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Why FloydCraft will not be involved with CubedCon 2019:<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ffcc99;\">We have bought Large Booths at both the 2017 and 2018 event and both times we have had problems with there staff, First of all The staff are <\/span><span style=\"color: #ffcc99;\">extremely incompetent.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ffff99;\">They say something will happen at a set time and it very rarely has in the 5 years I&#8217;ve attended.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ffcc99;\"><span style=\"color: #ffff99;\">more than 50% of there panels end up getting pushed back for some reason or another and it was frustrating to the large amount of there attendees,<\/span> especially from what we saw in our Cubed Channel in our own discord.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ffff99;\">The first year we bought our booth was 2017, <span style=\"color: #ffcc99;\">The Halloween Event.<\/span><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ffff99;\">The event its self was great with the exception of pretty much everything being delayed for some reason or another but the build server is where<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ffff99;\">you can see how under qualified there staff are!<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ffcc99;\">for example in the year 2017 we noticed a huge exploit they had.. you could use World Edit outside the build area and break everyone&#8217;s builds!<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ffcc99;\">if i had wanted to i could have gone into the sky and done<\/span> <span style=\"color: #ff99cc;\">\/\/cyl lava,water 1000<\/span> <span style=\"color: #ffcc99;\">and froze the entire thing and damaged all the booths in the<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ffcc99;\">process! Anyone could have if they had a booth!<\/span> <span style=\"color: #ffff99;\">and then we told them about it and they muted me.. for reporting a bug on there server that was a<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ffff99;\">huge problem.. and they did not fix it that whole year!<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ffff99;\">as well as that we was told we could use Player Heads to decorate with and so we did.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ffff99;\">they advised there was no limit and we could use as many as we wanted within reason.<\/span> <span style=\"color: #ffcc99;\">We placed 40 heads and they started removing them.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ffcc99;\">they didn&#8217;t message us in person at this point, they left a sign at our booth saying not to use too many heads, so we didn&#8217;t, we used around 20 that first year.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ffff99;\">Even though I was on a<span style=\"color: #ccffff;\"> Intel HD<\/span> card that gets on average <span style=\"color: #ff99cc;\">30FPS<\/span> and it was getting exactly <span style=\"color: #ff99cc;\">30FPS<\/span> they said they were too laggy and claimed they had\u00a0 good graphics cards but not all players will, yet there cards that were apparently too bad to go near our booth but there cards were better than mine, not even an<\/span> <span style=\"color: #ccffff;\">Intel on board.<\/span> <span style=\"color: #ffff99;\">Obviously they complacently lied to back up there argument so we would just remove them to avoid more arguing even tho tal was very angry and was ready to go out killing lol. <span style=\"color: #ccffcc;\">(not literally ofc)<\/span><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ffcc99;\">anyway we did as they asked and that year went by,<\/span> <span style=\"color: #ffff99;\">CubedCon 2018 was coming up,<\/span><span style=\"color: #ffcc99;\"> So again we bought a Large Booth, this time larger than the last!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ffff99;\">We spent way over a month building it, the build server was open a very long time due to the event getting pushed back.. again..<\/span><span style=\"color: #ffcc99;\"> the staff had<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ffcc99;\">mentioned on Discord that there were <strong>No limits on heads<\/strong> this year! that is exactly what they said and many of the staff watched me place them.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ffff99;\">I even got told by there staff that things looked great, and then the same thing happened, all our heads were too laggy apparently and we had to<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ffff99;\">remove them,<\/span> <span style=\"color: #ffcc99;\">we counted the heads and we had a total of <strong>42<\/strong> at the time which was just stupid that they would do that, especially after<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ffcc99;\">advertising a <strong>no limit on heads<\/strong>!,<\/span> <span style=\"color: #ffcc99;\">and then to back there argument up they changed the rules on discord!<\/span> <span style=\"color: #ffff99;\">of course as you can imagine we argued and a lot of us were a lot more angry than me, personally i taught it was a bit prosthetic and petty of the Cubed Staff but we did as they asked as we<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ffff99;\">didn&#8217;t need to argue with them any more.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ffcc99;\">The most annoying thing about it was that many of the staff watched us place the heads and even complimented it, they had many opportunity&#8217;s to say not to but they waited until we had spent months blending them in.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ffff99;\">After Cubed started there were many issues other than the panels getting pushed back and they neglected to put anything on there website<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ffff99;\">timetable. And then when they did it was almost over and they were still late!<\/span> <span style=\"color: #ffff99;\">it really seems like Cubed is becoming a Joke.<\/span><span style=\"color: #ffcc99;\">This year we got<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ffcc99;\">lucky and pulled out before we had to deal with there bullshit again, After we applied for our booth they got one of there pet staff to message<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ffcc99;\">me asking if they will have the same problems from us this year.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ffff99;\">Funny enough all the problems were caused by there incompetents! The Staff didn&#8217;t warn us about anything we were doing whilst doing it and we<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ffff99;\">literally followed the rules at that time,<\/span> <span style=\"color: #ffcc99;\">all we did was argue back a little in a professional manor as it really is ridiculous that they would<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ffcc99;\">even do that in the first place.<\/span> <span style=\"color: #ffcc99;\">and for them to ask us if were going to cause problems i told them to just decline out application,<\/span> <span style=\"color: #ffff99;\">The next<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ffff99;\">thing was pretty Funny,<\/span> <span style=\"color: #ffcc99;\">After i told them to decline it, they said to me<\/span><span style=\"color: #ffff99;\"> &#8220;we don&#8217;t think FloydCraft should be involved with Cubed anymore&#8221;<\/span>..<br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ffcc99;\">sentence flipping skills 10\/10 <span style=\"color: #ccffcc;\">[xD]<\/span><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ffff99;\">That is Why we will not be attending this shoddy event this year and we urge you all not to attend aswell,<\/span><span style=\"color: #ffcc99;\"> the staff are making it a poor experience<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ffcc99;\">for everyone getting involved and raising pretty much nothing for there charity Special Effect..<\/span> <span style=\"color: #ffcc99;\">they used to make a good \u00a31000 + but not any more<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ffcc99;\">and i can see why, they pretty much threw there money away messaging us about things from last year that were there own problems anyway.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ffff99;\">they act as if there a huge corporation that&#8217;s making a huge difference, There is So much that needs to change before the event is worth attending it<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ffff99;\">simply wont happen with there current staff.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #ffcc99;\">R.I.P CubedCon &#8211; once it was good..ish.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #ffff99; text-decoration: underline;\">See Screenshot of Message there pet staff sent when we applyed for 2019 Below:<\/span><\/strong><\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/TGQ8PiL.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/TGQ8PiL.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1289\" height=\"830\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ffcc99;\">In all Seriousness tho.
